										<h2>Hey Tiff | 9 July 2022 | Family Related</h2>

										<p> 
                                           Me and David landed in HCM city on Friday night, 8/7 around 11 pm. It was a rought flight, because
                                           David thought meals would be provided to all 8 hour international flights, but he was wrong, because Jetstar did not. He didn't tell me about it either so I didn't pack any food. We were so hungry because we did not want to spend money on overpriced meals on the plane. <br> The flight was delayed for 1 hour, we were starving and when we landed, we nearly got scammed, but thankfully I understood the language. We ended up paying 300k VND for a taxi, which was around 18 AUD to the hotel.
                                           <br>
                                           The next morning I texted my brother, that I would come and visit him, initially, they were very friendly, towards the end of the day, him and his wife and his MIL acted as if I owed them money. Everywhere we went, they expected me to pay for everything. <br>
                                           His wife knew we would be spending a whole day out, yet she didn't pack any extra water, snacks or nappy for the kids. The boy kept drinking my bottle of water that I packed for me and David, the girl actually peed her pants, and she wasn't wearing any diaper. So they went to our hotel room to clean the girl, but having no spare clothes to change into, they let the girl running, around half naked, yes, bottom half. We were in a crowded area, our hotel was a 5 star hotel, I felt second hand embarassed to be seen with them. Anyway, I said let's go get her a new pair of pants, and the MIL literally said, "let's go buy pants, your aunty is paying for it". I was okay with paying for it, it was her tone that made me pissed.
                                        <br>
                                            We went inside a big shopping centre, lots of high end brands, we just needed to go down a level to find cotton on, which is a cheaper brand in Aus. But nope, as soon as we walked in the shopping centre, the MIL said let's all go here, it was ZARA that she went into. Instead of looking for something on sale or affordable for me, she literally picked up the first thing she saw, put it on the kid and that was it. The short jeans costed me 50 AUD, yes 50 bucks for a 2 year old jean shorts, that would probably lasted her 3 months. The fact that I didn't even buy anything here in Aus for her that costed me that much pissed me off. 
                                            <h3>"I actually hate my brother and his whole family. Yes I said it."</h3>

                                            <br>
                                            Here's another fact. After they put on the shorts on the girl, I told them they need to find another shorts, put it on the baby for now, and take off the one they wanted so the cashier can take off the tag and scan the barcode. Once we paid then they can swap it around. He refused to do what I told him to, argued with me that he didn't need to and the cashier can just scan it like that. I said ok, it's your life. When it was his turn to pay, he lifted the baby up on the counter, and the cashier was like, no you need to take off the shorts, so he frantically put the baby down, stripped her and I went up to pay. While this was going on, the girl wouldn't stop crying. She was fully throwing tantrum for whatever reasons. 
                                            I felt really cheated because I didn't spend money buying clothes for her in Australia and yet he expected me to pay 50 bugs for a pair of short for two-year-old that won't last probably 8 months. <br>
  After I paid for the short we went outside and I asked the little boy if he was hungry and he said yes he was hungry and then I asked what he wanted to eat, He said he wanted fried chicken KFC to be exact and I said OK let's all go to have kfc then the mother in law stopped him slapping in the head that slightly not hard saying that what are you doing your auntie is here pick something more expensive why you eating cheap things fried chicken and your mum can cook fried chicken for you at home.  I lost all respect for her after she said that. To her and to his whole family I was just there to spend money on them not for me, not on me, not on my nephew or niece, but on them as in the brother the sister-in-law and his mother in law. I heard what she said I just didn't wanna go to any restaurant I decided to jus walk around.
We went to a ramen restaurant, and they ordered all these expensive dishes and drinks, while me and my boyfriend didn't order anything, and at the end, he just handed me the bill. Yup, he literally picked it up, and passed it to me, eventhough I didn't order anything. I still paid for it.
