										<h2>Hey Tiff | 13 Oct 2022 | To the bitch I thought was my friend</h2>

										<p>Cindy Duong of Canley Vale of Sydney, NSW, Australia, who works at Lendi, whose boyfriend is a PE teacher at Cabramatta High, if you're reading this, fuck you for betraying me like that you 2 faced, entitled, self-centred, crazy, ugly bitch. Get your head out of your ass and stop victimising yourself. Not everything is about you and I honestly never give you a second thought when we played basketball, let alone excluding you. You got everything handed to you your whole life, and when things don't go your way, suddenly everyone is against you.<br><br>  
											1. You said you didn't like the fact that I talked about people behind their backs. Bitch, name those people, I dare you! Who did I talk about behind their backs? You know exactly 4 of my friends, one is actually my boyfriend and you said I talked about them? Go ahead, tell them what I said! Because I can tell you right now, you don't have shit to say to them because 1. You made this whole thing up to justify your actions 2. You don't know anything about my friends to say because I've never spoken badly about the people I love. <br>
										
											Feel free to take a look at yourself in the mirror first and stop acting all high and mighty, because you talked about people behind their backs too, you 2 faced bitch. Do I need to remind you of a certain guy, named Adrian, that you used to play game with, that you hated and wouldn't stop talking about him? Remember him? How exactly are you different from what you claimed me to be, you hypocrite? At the very least, I don't backstab the people I consider my friends, unlike you you fat ugly bitch. <br><br>

											2. You said I excluded you and not let you on the court to play. Like what bitch? My friend was looking at me asking for sub, she was better than me on the court so I told her to stay on, while she was talking and looking at me, and you took that somehow as me wanting to keep you on the bench? Like bitch, how self centred can you be? <br>
											How could someone make something that was completely unrelated to them about themselves? Was she looking at you? NO. Was she talking to you? NO. You know why she didn't do any of those things, because she knew you suck at the sports, no matter how hard you tried. You looked like a headless chicken on the court, and not a pretty one, chasing the ball, regardless of whether you were on offence or not. 
											<br><br>
											3. You said I excluded you from joining the team in a mean way. Let me try and explain to you how life works like you're a fucking 5 year old child. When someone invited you to join their Tuesday team, in addition to their Thursday team, which you were already in, that was not a gesture of exclusion. You saying no to joining their Tuesday team because you wanted to play Oztag, was not their fault. This was not them excluding you. So when I fucking invited you to come play with me and my friends on Tuesday, you said no, how in the world did that mean I excluded you from joining the team? What part of your brain were you using when blaming this on me? Furthermore, I introduced you to the league, brought you to the team on Sunday, let you play in the same team with my friends because I liked you, got you a jersey (even though you were not supposed to have one, because you were not part of the team the season before), brought you to the Thursday team, we played for 2 seasons, and suddenly I excluded you? I even got you to play with us in the Fiba world cup exhibition game a few weeks ago with my friends, for free, you fucking played, and somehow I excluded you? <br>
											<br>
											<h3>Honestly, tying all this out makes me brain hurt, because it's mind numbing to realise just how fucking selfish and closed-minded you really are.</h3>

											4.You said I excluded you because I didn't let you play the last 5 mins of the game today. Bitch please, you were on the bottom of my list of "Shit I give a fuck about". Did you not see me called Harry's name and jumped on the court? If you want to sub on, call a name and jump on, like I did. Don't fucking blame your mental problem on me because I didn't tell you to jump on. You're an adult, be an adult. I'm not playing basketball and spoonfeeding you at the same time. Again, you made this whole thing about yourself, like why do I give a shit about you? Like why do I care if you wanted to play the game or not? Did it ever occur to you that people didn't want to sub you on because of the way you acted? You never said hi to the people in the team, you never talked to people in the team, you sat on the bench, crossing your arms, looking unfriendly as fuck, no wonder why people didn't care that you left the team.<br><br>
											5. If you have something to say, be a decent human being and speak up. Instead you chose to be 2 faced to me and everyone, all friendly and smiling when we talked to you, but you were bottling up and just quit the team when you felt like it. Everyone in the team was so shocked to see your message, but we all agreed that you dramatised the entire thing. NO ONE WAS ON YOUR SIDE, NOT EVEN SYLVIA AND MATT, the 2 strangers in our team. <br><br>
											<h3>Haters gonna hate.</h3>
											Let me tell you one thing, when my friend Harry reached out to you, let be clear of one thing, he didn't give a shit about you. He cared about me and didn't want me to lose a friend, that was why he reached out. Don't fucking flatter yourself thinking that he was on your side. He is still one of my closest friends to this day, what about you bitch? Got any friends to care for you? No, not even your boyfriend cared enough about you to accompany you to Melbourne in April 2022. He was so in love with you that was why he let you go to Melbourne all by yourself for 3 days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) and let you shared a hostel room with random people. My long term boyfriend of 12 years wouldn't even let me walk alone at 7pm, let alone travelling by myself. <br>
											You said I excluded you, but who in the right mind would share their personal life to that person who bullied them? You told me all about your life, your job, your salary, your bf, your house which you got it for free from your bf's parents, your brother, your family, and how your bf's mum cooks for you and you didn't have to cook or clean. Like why would you tell me all that if you secretly hate me you fucking 2 faced bitch????
											<br>
											You are so lonely and sad that you have to go onto the internet to ask strangers for advice. At least I have friends that I can rely on and ask for advice. Your own bf disrespected you (saying you had a funny looking face) while I was on a call with you, and you didn't even stand up for yourself to him, yet you said you needed to stand up for yourself with me. Like when did I bully you bitch? Did you even watch any of the recordings of the games?<br>
											<br>
											<h3>CINDY DUONG, YOU ARE A HORRIBLE BITCH THAT NO ONE WANTS TO BE FRIENDS WITH AND I AM GLAD YOU ARE NO LONGER IN MY LIFE. WE ALL KNOW YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS, SO PLEASE DO US A FAVOUR AND STOP ACTING LIKE YOU HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS.</h3>
											Good riddance!<br>
											Anyway, I said what I needed to say. I wish you all the bad luck, you ungrateful bitch.<br>
