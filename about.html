									<h2>About this site</h2>

									<p>Hi, my name is Tiffany and I made this site to serve as my personal digital diary about my life journey.
                                        Due to childhood trauma, I have a hard time dealing with people, so I made this site to document what I learn, how I feel, and also to look back later.
                                  I never shared this site with anyone, not even friends, not even my long term boyfriend. I love my friends and my boyfriend to death, but this is for me and me only. </p>

									<h3>What Brought Me Here</h3>
									<p>At the age of 26, it finally hit me why I have trouble making friends and connecting with people, my childhood trauma that played a major role in my mental development.
                                        I decided to not live like that anymore and began the process of healing, starting with accepting the past is the past and I should stop blaming it. The people who did me wrong are still in denial, and as a result, I cut tight with them. 
                                        So here I am on my journey to become a better person.
                                    </p>
