										<h2>Hey Tiff | 14 Oct 2022</h2>

										<p>You are so gulible and stupid to trust everyone you met. 
											Everyone is inherently trustworthy in your eyes and look what it got you. You need to remember that 
											every person acts in a manner that is best for themselves. 
											Look beyond the words of that person to learn their true nature, and you can see if they will act in a way you want them to. 
											Accept, however, that you always take a risk with people, as neither you nor they truly know themselves.
										</p>

										<h3>"You are not responsible for the stories other people tell themselves"</h3>
										<p>Betrayal doesn't exist. We only feel betrayed when our expectations were incorrect. 
											Every person acts according to their own beliefs. Often they are not aware of what their true beliefs are, and they make promises that they wouldn't have made if they had a deeper understanding of themselves. 
										</p>

										<p>What you should learned by now is that people will make anything you say or do about themselves. You could be sharing a general stories and they see it as a direct attack to who they are, and they completely believe 
											that they are right and will not listen to anything you say. 
											Cut tight of those people and be happy that you are no longer surrounded by selfish and close minded people. Good riddance!

										</p>
										<p>Keep smiling!</p>
