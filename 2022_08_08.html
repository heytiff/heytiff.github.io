										<h2>Hey Tiff | 08 August 2022 | AmITheAsshole</h2>

										<p>I am having a tough time dealing with my older brother, who is 5 years older than me. 
                                           <br>Background: He lives overseas, in Vietnam with his wife and 2 kids, both under the age of 10. His wife is a stay-at-home mum, he works as a labourer. They also live with her mother.<br>
                                            
										</p>

										<h3>I have never ever in my life asked my older brother for money, ever.</h3>
										<p> 
										</p>

										<p>In 2021, my youngest aunt told me that after my dad passed away, I received an inheritance from the sale of his house in Vietnam, which was split into 3 equal parts, me, my brother and my step mother, each got around 25k AUD. I did not know that he owned the house, and that I got an inheritance. 
                                            I only found out about the money when my aunt told me about it, and the only reason why she told me about it was that my brother, after receiving my share of the inheritance, instead of contacting me and transfering me the share, he decided he would spend my inheritance on booze and parties. <br>
                                            My aunt was furious that he spent all my money, without even telling me, because she was supposed to contact me and send me the money, but he insisted on contacting me. 
                                            <br>
                                            Anyway, because I wasn't aware of the fact that he spent 25k AUD that belonged to me, and before my aunt knew about him spending all the money, he contacted me out of nowhere, and instead of telling me about the inheritance that I got, HE ASKED FOR MONEY! Yes, he contacted me to ask for help with the rent because he couldn't afford to pay for the rent, because his job wasn't paying him enough to raise his children. <br>
                                            Me, not knowing that he spent my money, decided to send him $100 AUD per month to help him out. Once my aunt knew about me sending him money every month, she talked to me and found out that I never got the money from my dad, and that was when I realised, my older brother spent my inheretance. Not on his kids, not on the house, on booze, parties and lending money to his friends without asking them to pay back. Yes, I know this because we had a 3 way phone call with him and my aunt, where I asked where all the money went point blank, he told me, then my aunt asked him to ask his friends to pay back, to which he said, he would try, but he didn't think he would get any back since they were all broke as well. 
                                            <br>
                                            My mind blew.
                                            Fast forward to today, she kept pushing me to do the paper works to sponsor him and his family over, I said no, not going to happen. It would cost me more than 20k AUD to sponsor his whole family over here, and then what? I would have to take care of him and his family for 4 years before they get citizenship. I do not want this burden on me. <br>
                                            She then suggested that I should adopt his oldest child as my son. I was so supprised but then she kept on insisting me to have an appointment with her lawyer friend, so I booked an appointment out of shear pressure. But then I cancelled the appointment. I told her I do not want to adopt anyone right now. I am still young. I need to enjoy my life. I will adopt when I am ready to have kids, right now I am not. 
                                            So am I the asshole for not sponsoring him or adopting his child?

										</p>
										<p>Keep smiling!</p>
